     <h1>Hello World</h1>
     
     <h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
     
       <p> I would love to see Hawaii for myself instead 
       of in movies or pictures. It seems so peaceful and 
       fun to visit, yet expensive.That was always on my bucket 
       list to visit that place. The water looks so fresh 
       and the people seem so nice.</p>
       
     <h2>A Person I Admire</h2>  
        
        <p>A person i admire is my father. He is a very 
        hard working person who is always there for the people he loves. 
        His hard work and dedication to his family is very admirable. 
        I feel that many people should be like him. He is brave 
        and ambitious and if he wasn't then i don't know where i'd be.</p>
